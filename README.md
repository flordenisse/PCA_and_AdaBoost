# Machine Learning: PCA and AdaBoost

The objective of this proyect was to use the dataset [Breast Cancer Coimbra](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/451/breast+cancer+coimbra) to train a model that can classify healthy and cancer patients. To achieve this, we used the PCA method to reduce dimensionality, then the AdaBoost method for the classifier, and finally compared it with Random Forest.

The dataset contains clinical features of 64 breast cancer patients and 52 healthy controls. There are 9 quantitative attributes (age, BMI, glucose, insulin, HOMA, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, MCP.1) and one binary class (healthy patient or cancer patient).
